                    <p>
                        After my time at university I wanted to spend some time developing skills
                        in another of my passions, music. I decided on this course as it is more
                        focused on developing technical skills such as setting up microphones for
                        live recordings, working in the studio with real studio quality equipment
                        and mixing and mastering tracks. During my time at college I learned a lot
                        about working in a timely manner with deadlines for clients, working with
                        real clients/musicians in a professional environment and how many avenues
                        there are in the sound production world.

                        software design and development, advanced mathematics and mobile 
                        application development and covering many languages such as C, C++, Java, 
                        C#, R and some basic assembly. During my time at university, I have taken

                        After using bet calculators after working in a bookmakers I wanted to create one of my own with my own style

                        progressing over time as my skills improve. I am not using any frameworks such as React or Vue for this
                        project as this is an introduction to web dev, however I do plan to use these frameworks in the future.

                        After working on Parley together, our team decided we wanted to continue
                        developing games together. We are currently working on expanding the ideas
                        we had during Parleys development and are in the early stages of working on
                        this project. We aim to have a full release for the game on Steam at some
                        point in the future.

                        While at college we were offered the opportunity to participate in the
                        Fife College game jam where we had to work as a team and develop a game
                        in 5 days. As I have some experience working in game dev as a hobby I 
                        decided that I would take part in the event and asked two of my classmates
                        if they would be interested in taking part in the event as I wouldn't be
                        able to work on the sound and music while also programming. We were later
                        joined by two more members, both animators and 3D artists. This left me as 
                        the only developer which was a challenge, but one that I was willing to 
                        face. We managed to develop and release our game within the time frame 
                        and won the student choice award for our submission. This release was 
                        not a completed game and has a very simple gameplay loop and has some
                        unadressed bugs but we were proud of our work for the timeframe we had. 
                        The game is available to play by clicking the itch.io link below.
